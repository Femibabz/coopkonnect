## âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

### What's Been Implemented:

**Activation Token System:**
- Added `ActivationToken` interface with 72-hour expiration
- Token generation, validation, and usage tracking
- Secure token storage in localStorage

**Updated Admin Approval Process:**
- Admin approval now creates activation tokens instead of user accounts
- Sends email with secure activation link instead of credentials
- 72-hour time limit for account activation

**Account Activation Page (`/activate-account`):**
- Validates activation tokens (checks expiry, usage status)
- Allows society reps to set their own username/password
- Time remaining display (expires in X hours)
- Error handling for invalid/expired/used tokens
- Success flow redirects to login

**Enhanced Email Flow:**
- Professional activation email template
- Clear instructions and time limits
- Activation URL with secure token parameter

### How It Works:
1. **Society applies** via registration form
2. **Admin approves** application in admin dashboard
3. **System creates** society + activation token (72hr expiry)
4. **Email sent** to society rep with activation link
5. **Rep clicks link** and sets up username/password
6. **Account activated** and ready for login

### Next Steps:
- Test the complete flow end-to-end
- Deploy to production for live testing
